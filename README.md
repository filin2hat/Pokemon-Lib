Pokedex demonstrates modern Android development with Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, 
Jetpack (Retrofit, ViewModel), and Material Design based on MVVM architecture.
</p>

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries

- Minimum SDK level 26
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
  based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines)
    + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/)
      for asynchronous.
- Jetpack
    - Compose: for UI
    - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive
      configuration changes such as screen rotations.
    - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): for dependency injection.
- Architecture
    - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)
    - Repository Pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Construct the REST APIs and paging
  network data.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android):
  Material design components for building some components.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil): Image loading
- [Palette](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/palette): Extract representative
  color palettes
  from images.
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber): A logger with a small, extensible API.

## Architecture

**Pokedex** is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern, which follows
the [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

The overall architecture of **Pokedex** is composed of two layers; the UI layer and the data layer.
Each layer has dedicated components and they have each different responsibilities, as defined below:

**Pokedex** was built
with [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), so it would be a
great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects.

Pokedex using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for constructing RESTful API.<br>
PokeAPI provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of
data related to Pok√©mon.
