## Architecture

**Pokedex** is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern, which follows
the [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

The overall architecture of **Pokedex** is composed of two layers; the UI layer and the data layer.
Each layer has dedicated components and they have each different responsibilities, as defined below:

**Pokedex** was built
with [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), so it would be a
great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects.

Pokedex using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for constructing RESTful API.<br>
PokeAPI provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of
data related to Pok√©mon.
